Hi! My name is Nikita and I'm self-taught web developer from Russia, Moscow.

I can't count times I've created new blogs in new tech stack and I promise this won't be the last one. This is my blog about developer routine things and my daily routine as a runner, Volvo driver and console gamer. Sometimes I like to just share stuff I've found in the internet and think it is worth sharing with other people.

I've started my blogging long time ago from Wordpress, Modx, Drupal and other heavy monsters, then I changed it all to static site generators such as Gatsby, Eleventy and others. I like poking around new technologies and trying to make them useful for me or for my work.

I'm always open to communication or new opportunities, you can find me at my [Github](https://github.com/Defite) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitamakhov/).
